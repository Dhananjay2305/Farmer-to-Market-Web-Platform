🌾 Farmer-to-Market Web Platform (FarmDirect)

A web platform that connects farmers directly with buyers/retailers to reduce dependency on middlemen, increase farmer profits, and ensure price transparency.

📌 Problem Statement

Middlemen control pricing
Farmers have limited market access
Lack of transparency in buying/selling

💡 Solution
This platform allows:
Farmers to list produce directly
Buyers to view listings and send offers
Farmers to accept/reject offers
Direct communication via WhatsApp/Call
