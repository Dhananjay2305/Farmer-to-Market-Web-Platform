# Farmer-to-Market-Web-Platform
Farmer-to-Market Web Platform is a web application that helps farmers sell their produce directly to buyers without middlemen. Farmers can list crops with price, quantity, and location, while buyers can browse listings, send offers, and contact farmers directly. This improves farmer profits and ensures price transparency in the market.

🌾 Farmer-to-Market Web Platform

This project is built to reduce farmer losses caused by middlemen by enabling direct trading between farmers and buyers. Farmers can easily upload produce listings (crop name, quantity, expected price, location, and photo). Buyers can view listings, apply filters, send offers, and connect with farmers through WhatsApp/call. The platform supports transparent pricing and helps both farmers and retailers make faster, fairer deals.
