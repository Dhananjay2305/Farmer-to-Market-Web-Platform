# Farmer-to-Market-Web-Platform
Farmer-to-Market Web Platform is a web application that helps farmers sell their produce directly to buyers without middlemen. Farmers can list crops with price, quantity, and location, while buyers can browse listings, send offers, and contact farmers directly. This improves farmer profits and ensures price transparency in the market.
