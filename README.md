🌾 Farmer-to-Market Web Platform

This project is built to reduce farmer losses caused by middlemen by enabling direct trading between farmers and buyers. Farmers can easily upload produce listings (crop name, quantity, expected price, location, and photo). Buyers can view listings, apply filters, send offers, and connect with farmers through WhatsApp/call. The platform supports transparent pricing and helps both farmers and retailers make faster, fairer deals.
